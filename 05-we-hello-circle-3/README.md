# Hello Circle 3

## Introduction

In this activity, we will commit code changes to trigger a simple CI/CD pipeline using CircleCI.

## Instructions

1. Log in to [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) and navigate to the `CiCdDemo` pipeline.
   - Keep this browser window open as we make changes so we can view the pipeline run.

2. Open the `hello-circle` project in IntelliJ, create a Test Class called `com.company.hellocircle.controller.HelloCircleControllerTest`, and add the following test:

    ```java
    @Test
    public void shouldReturnAnswer() throws Exception {
        // arrange and act
        mockMvc.perform(get("/answer"))
                .andDo(print())
                .andExpect(status().isOk())

                // assert
                .andExpect(content().string("The answer is 42!"));
    }
    ```

    > **Note:** If the test is throwing errors or you become stuck, reference the `starter` code for guidance.

3. Save your changes and commit them to the local CiCdDemo repo.

4. Push your changes to the remote CiCdDemo repo.

5. In the browser window for the `CiCdDemo` pipeline, the pipeline will run and fail because the test fails.

6. In IntelliJ, edit the `com.company.hellocircle.controller.HelloCircleController` class, and add the following endpoint:

    ```java
    @GetMapping(value = "/answer")
    public String getAnswer(){
        return "The answer is 42!";
    }
    ```

7. Save your changes and commit them to the local CiCdDemo repo.

8. Push your changes to the remote CiCdDemo repo.

9. In the browser window for the `CiCdDemo` pipeline, the pipeline will run and complete successfully because all of the tests now pass.
